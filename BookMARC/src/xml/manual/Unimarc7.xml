  <FIELD tag="7--" name="INTELLECTUAL RESPONSIBILITY BLOCK" mandatory="y" repeatable="y">
    <DESCRIPTION>This block contains names of persons and corporate bodies having some form of intellectual responsibility for the creation of the item described. Intellectual responsibility is defined broadly to include all persons, corporate bodies or families associated with an item including publishers when an access point is required. The following fields are defined: 

Personal Names 

700 Personal Name - Primary Intellectual Responsibility
701 Personal Name - Alternative Intellectual Responsibility
702 Personal Name - Secondary Intellectual Responsibility


Corporate Body and Meeting Names 

710 Corporate Body Name - Primary Intellectual Responsibility
711 Corporate Body Name - Alternative Intellectual Responsibility
712 Corporate Body Name - Secondary Intellectual Responsibility 

Family Names 

720 Family Name - Primary Intellectual Responsibility
721 Family Name - Alternative Intellectual Responsibility
722 Family Name - Secondary Intellectual Responsibility
730 Name - Intellectual Responsibility 
</DESCRIPTION>
    <NOTES>One person, corporate body or family may be selected as having primary responsibility. In some cataloguing codes this is called the main entry. Any other persons, corporate bodies or families having equal responsibility are considered to have alternative responsibility. If a given cataloguing code does not embody the concept of main entry, all persons, corporate bodies and families having equal responsibility may be coded as if they had alternative responsibility. Persons, corporate bodies or families having tangential responsibility (e.g., editors, translators, illustrators, etc.) may be coded as having secondary responsibility. If it is not possible to determine any level of responsibility, all names should be coded as alternative. 

Main entry under title: 

In records catalogued according to codes recognising the concept of main entry, when no personal or corporate name has been specified as having primary responsibility for an item, it can be assumed that main entry is under title. Access points for persons or bodies associated with the item are given in the alternative or secondary responsibility fields as appropriate. For example, multiple authors, which preclude an author main entry under some cataloguing codes, would each be considered as having alternative responsibility; whereas the editor of a collection (which is entered under title by some cataloguing codes) would be considered to have secondary responsibility. When the main entry is under title, the main entry will be found in field 500 if present, otherwise in field 200.

    <NOTES>Form: 

The form of name which appears in the field is determined by the appropriate cataloguing rules and/or authorities used by the agency responsible for the preparation of the record. Dates may be entered according to different calendars. 

Selection of subfields: 

It may not always appear obvious, when presented with a source record to be converted to UNIMARC, which sub-elements of the name in a source format correspond to which UNIMARC subfields. These notes are intended to give general guidance but are not exhaustive. It is necessary to be aware that names formed according to different cataloguing rules, or even originating from different authority files based on the same rules will not always interfile correctly in one sequence. Until standards are established UNIMARC can provide only a framework for identifying the distinct data elements. 

One way of conceiving of the differences between Entry Element ($a), Part of Name Other than Entry Element ($b), and Additions to Names Other than Dates ($c) is by referring to their use. The first element, entry element, is the word under which the entry would be formed in an ordered list. The second element subdivides the list ordered by the first element. The third element, Additions to Names Other than Dates, will either be used as a third filing element, or may in some cases, especially when it precedes the Part of Name Other than Entry Element, be ignored for ordering purposes. 

Where family names begin with a particle such as a preposition, it will be placed at the start of subfield $a. If the name files under the next element after the particle, the particle will usually be placed at the end of the name. It is recommended that these particles be entered in subfield $b Part of Name Other than Entry Element (EX 9, 10, 11). 

Titles of address, epithets or qualifiers to names added by the cataloguer should be entered as Additions to Names Other than Dates, subfield $c. 

Punctuation: 

There are no standards for punctuation in this field. However, it is recommended that punctuation be retained where it is available in the source format. In source formats where punctuation is not available, but is printed out by an algorithm generated from the definition of the subfields, it is recommended that the punctuation which would be used in display be included in the UNIMARC record. 

Because there are no standards for punctuation in this field, recipients of records in the UNIMARC format will have to be aware of the practices adopted by the agency preparing the record; therefore agencies distributing records should attempt to be consistent in their own records. Details should be included in the documentation accompanying exchange tapes (See Appendix K).

      <DESCRIPTION>Data in field 200 is recorded as it appears on the item. The name of the person mentioned in $f or in some cases $g to whom is attributed primary responsibility for the item (if any) will be entered in 700 in a form suitable for an access point. </DESCRIPTION>

      <DESCRIPTION>If there are further persons considered to have equal or alternative responsibility to the person named in field 700, field 701 is used to record the required access points for these. This will occur when documents are written 'by Glenn L. Jenkins, Adelbert M. Knevel, Frank E. Di Gangi', or in the provisions of certain cataloguing rules when complementary text and illustrations, for example photographs and accompanying text are the responsibility of different persons. One or other of the persons with equal responsibility will be entered in field 700, the other(s) in 701, without any implication that the ones entered in 701 fields have any less responsibility for the item than the one entered in 700. Where the cataloguing rules do not recognise 'main entry' primary personal responsibility, headings are entered in field 701 and field 700 is not used.

The above examples illustrate different 700 fields for the same entity that result from various agencies because of variations in the access point form: Lawrence, D.H. or Lawrence, David Herbert or Lawrence, D.H. (David Herbert). The variations result from the application of different cataloguing rules for headings. The third example above includes parentheses to distinguish between the preferred form of the forenames and the full form. </EX>

      <EX n="5">
700 #0$aMao Tse Tung
700 #l$aMao,$bTse Tung
Chinese names are in normal usage (outside cataloguing) written with the family name first. This results in differing treatment among cataloguing codes. Mao Tse-Tung (to use one possible rendering of the name into the roman alphabet) may be entered according to some cataloguing codes as: Mao Tse-Tung; according to others as Mao, Tse-Tung. This is because some codes feel that the punctuation, in this case a separating comma ',' represents the division between family name and given names while others feel that a comma denotes inversion from the usual form and omit it here since no inversion has been required. Note that when the name is entered in direct order, i.e. under the name which comes first, and the whole of the name is entered in the same subfield, the second indicator, Form of Name Indicator, is set to 0. However, if the first element is regarded as a surname by analogy with Western treatment of surnames, then the second indicator is set to 1.</EX>

    <NOTES>
Form: 

The form of name which appears in the field is determined by the appropriate cataloguing rules and/or authorities used by the agency responsible for the preparation of the record. Dates may be entered according to different calendars. 

Selection of subfields: 

It may not always appear obvious, when presented with a source record to be converted to UNIMARC, which sub-elements of the name in a source format correspond to which UNIMARC subfields. These notes are intended to give general guidance but are not exhaustive. It is necessary to be aware that names formed according to different cataloguing rules, or even originating from different authority files based on the same rules will not always interfile correctly in one sequence. Until standards are established UNIMARC can provide only a framework for identifying the distinct data elements. 

One way of conceiving of the differences between Entry Element ($a), Part of Name Other than Entry Element ($b), and Additions to Names Other than Dates ($c) is by referring to their use. The first element, entry element, is the word under which the entry would be formed in an ordered list. The second element subdivides the list ordered by the first element. The third element, Additions to Names Other than Dates, will either be used as a third filing element, or may in some cases, especially when it precedes the Part of Name Other than Entry Element, be ignored for ordering purposes. 

Where family names begin with a particle such as a preposition, it will be placed at the start of subfield $a. If the name files under the next element after the particle, the particle will usually be placed at the end of the name. It is recommended that these particles be entered in subfield $b Part of Name Other than Entry Element (EX 9, 10, 11). 

Titles of address, epithets or qualifiers to names added by the cataloguer should be entered as Additions to Names Other than Dates, subfield $c. 

Punctuation: 

There are no standards for punctuation in this field. However, it is recommended that punctuation be retained where it is available in the source format. In source formats where punctuation is not available, but is printed out by an algorithm generated from the definition of the subfields, it is recommended that the punctuation which would be used in display be included in the UNIMARC record. 

Because there are no standards for punctuation in this field, recipients of records in the UNIMARC format will have to be aware of the practices adopted by the agency preparing the record; therefore agencies distributing records should attempt to be consistent in their own records. Details should be included in the documentation accompanying exchange tapes (See Appendix K). 
The field is used, where applicable for printers, publishers, former owners and other connected with the production or history of particular volumes. 

Subfield $5, code of the Institution to Which Field Applies is used only when the physical characteristics are peculiar to an individual copy. It is generally used for older monographic publications (antiquarian).

    <NOTES>Form: 

The form of the name which appears in this field is determined by the appropriate cataloguing rules and/or authorities used by the agency responsible for the preparation of the record. 

It may not always appear obvious, when presented with a source record to be converted to UNIMARC, which sub-elements of the name in a source format correspond to which UNIMARC subfields. These notes are intended to give general guidance but are not exhaustive. It is necessary to be aware that names formed according to different cataloguing rules or even originating from different authority files based on the same rules will not always inter-file correctly in one sequence. Until further standards are established UNIMARC can provide only a framework for identifying the distinct data elements. 

Corporate names are problematic since many corporate bodies do not have a precise name which remains constant. Furthermore individual cataloguing rules formalise the names in different ways and therefore use different kinds of data elements. 

Inverted data: 

One type of name which often presents difficulties is a corporate name formed from a personal name, e.g., W. H. Smith &amp; Sons Ltd, J. F. Kennedy Center, Winston Churchill Memorial Centre. Some cataloguing codes stipulate that these should be entered in direct order in subfield $a; other rules require that the names be treated as a personal name and inverted hence coded in subfields $g and $h. UNIMARC accommodates both possibilities (EX 9, 10, 14). 

Entry under place: 

Names of governments at all levels, e.g. national, provincial, and local, are formalisations of a different kind. Many such bodies have long formal names, but the practice of cataloguing codes is generally to take a short name of the place, e.g., France, Australia, rather than the formal name (Republic of France, Commonwealth of Australia) (EX 7). Subordinate governmental bodies are often prefixed with the name of the government (EX 5, 6). Cataloguing rules vary as to whether bodies under government control but without legislative or executive power, such as national museums, are entered under the name of the government or under their own names. If entered under their own name, e.g., Civic Museum, they may need a qualification to distinguish between other organisations of the same name in other places. Some cataloguing rules have a further category of organisation entered under name of place: bodies like universities, learned societies etc. which are specifically attached to a place and tend to have the place name as part of their name; these may formalised in such a way as to bring the name of the place to the fore (EX 15). The remainder of the name will be stripped of connecting prepositions; thus it is not strictly an inversion. 

Qualifications: 

Guidance may be required on what elements are to be considered qualifications and hence are to be entered in subfield $c. This may be a place added in order to distinguish the body from others of the same name, e.g., Liberal Party (Australia). It may be a statement of type of body to distinguish it from a different type of body with the same name, e.g. Gibraltar (Diocese) to distinguish it from the colony, and New York (State) to distinguish it from the city. A third kind of addition consists of a term added to a name to convey that it is a corporate body, e.g., Eagles (Rugby club), Ecologica (Firm), HVJ (Radio station) (EX 16). Usually cataloguing rules prescribe that the qualification be added in parentheses as in the examples above. 

Formalised additions to names of meetings: 

There are no universally accepted standards for the data elements 'Number', 'Location' and 'Date of meeting'. Numbers may be in Arabic or roman numerals, place names may be entered according to the language of the record, or the language on the original (EX 11-14). The date may be entered in any form, although for an exchange record, if month and day are required in the heading, the date in international standard format (e.g., '19831101', for 1 November 1983) is recommended as it can easily be converted into any language if desired. 

Punctuation 

There are no standards for punctuation in this field. It is recommended that punctuation be retained where it is available in the source format. In source formats where punctuation is not available, but is printed out by an algorithm generated from the definition of the subfields, it is recommended that the punctuation which would be used in display be included in the UNIMARC record. This includes parentheses which occur at the beginning and end of one or a group of subfields. 

Because there are no standards for punctuation in this field, recipients of records in the UNIMARC format will have to be aware of the practices adopted by the agency preparing the record. Agencies distributing records should attempt to be consistent in their own records. Details should be included in the documentation accompanying exchange tapes (See Appendix K).

    <NOTES>Form: 

The form of the name which appears in this field is determined by the appropriate cataloguing rules and/or authorities used by the agency responsible for the preparation of the record. 

It may not always appear obvious, when presented with a source record to be converted to UNIMARC, which sub-elements of the name in a source format correspond to which UNIMARC subfields. These notes are intended to give general guidance but are not exhaustive. It is necessary to be aware that names formed according to different cataloguing rules or even originating from different authority files based on the same rules will not always inter-file correctly in one sequence. Until further standards are established UNIMARC can provide only a framework for identifying the distinct data elements. 

Corporate names are problematic since many corporate bodies do not have a precise name which remains constant. Furthermore individual cataloguing rules formalise the names in different ways and therefore use different kinds of data elements. 

Inverted data: 

One type of name which often presents difficulties is a corporate name formed from a personal name, e.g., W. H. Smith &amp; Sons Ltd, J. F. Kennedy Center, Winston Churchill Memorial Centre. Some cataloguing codes stipulate that these should be entered in direct order in subfield $a; other rules require that the names be treated as a personal name and inverted hence coded in subfields $g and $h. UNIMARC accommodates both possibilities (EX 9, 10, 14). 

Entry under place: 

Names of governments at all levels, e.g. national, provincial, and local, are formalisations of a different kind. Many such bodies have long formal names, but the practice of cataloguing codes is generally to take a short name of the place, e.g., France, Australia, rather than the formal name (Republic of France, Commonwealth of Australia) (EX 7). Subordinate governmental bodies are often prefixed with the name of the government (EX 5, 6). Cataloguing rules vary as to whether bodies under government control but without legislative or executive power, such as national museums, are entered under the name of the government or under their own names. If entered under their own name, e.g., Civic Museum, they may need a qualification to distinguish between other organisations of the same name in other places. Some cataloguing rules have a further category of organisation entered under name of place: bodies like universities, learned societies etc. which are specifically attached to a place and tend to have the place name as part of their name; these may formalised in such a way as to bring the name of the place to the fore (EX 15). The remainder of the name will be stripped of connecting prepositions; thus it is not strictly an inversion. 

Qualifications: 

Guidance may be required on what elements are to be considered qualifications and hence are to be entered in subfield $c. This may be a place added in order to distinguish the body from others of the same name, e.g., Liberal Party (Australia). It may be a statement of type of body to distinguish it from a different type of body with the same name, e.g. Gibraltar (Diocese) to distinguish it from the colony, and New York (State) to distinguish it from the city. A third kind of addition consists of a term added to a name to convey that it is a corporate body, e.g., Eagles (Rugby club), Ecologica (Firm), HVJ (Radio station) (EX 16). Usually cataloguing rules prescribe that the qualification be added in parentheses as in the examples above. 

Formalised additions to names of meetings: 

There are no universally accepted standards for the data elements 'Number', 'Location' and 'Date of meeting'. Numbers may be in Arabic or roman numerals, place names may be entered according to the language of the record, or the language on the original (EX 11-14). The date may be entered in any form, although for an exchange record, if month and day are required in the heading, the date in international standard format (e.g., '19831101', for 1 November 1983) is recommended as it can easily be converted into any language if desired. 

Punctuation 

There are no standards for punctuation in this field. It is recommended that punctuation be retained where it is available in the source format. In source formats where punctuation is not available, but is printed out by an algorithm generated from the definition of the subfields, it is recommended that the punctuation which would be used in display be included in the UNIMARC record. This includes parentheses which occur at the beginning and end of one or a group of subfields. 

Because there are no standards for punctuation in this field, recipients of records in the UNIMARC format will have to be aware of the practices adopted by the agency preparing the record. Agencies distributing records should attempt to be consistent in their own records. Details should be included in the documentation accompanying exchange tapes (See Appendix K).

Punctuation: 

There are no standards for punctuation in this field. However, it is recommended that punctuation be retained where it is available in the source format. If the source format uses additional subfields it is recommended that punctuation be printed out by an algorithm generated from the definition of the additional subfields. Because there are no standards for punctuation in this field, recipients of records in the UNIMARC format will have to be aware of the practices adopted by the agency preparing the record. Agencies distributing records should attempt to be consistent in their own records.

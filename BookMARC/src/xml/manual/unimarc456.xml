		<DESCRIPTION>"The primary purpose of UNIMARC is to facilitate the international exchange of bibliographic data in machinereadable form between national bibliographic agencies. UNIMARC may also be used as a model for the development of new machinereadable bibliographic formats" - Purpose and Scope of UNIMARC. 

It is therefore important that the UNIMARC format be hospitable to other MARC formats: otherwise conversion to and from UNIMARC is difficult or even impossible. 

For this reason the technique of embedded fields has been supplemented by a technique using standard subfields. The structure of the agency's records will determine which system of linking entry fields is used. 

Where there is a choice of system, the agency should weigh the advantages of the linking entry system, which allows fuller although more complex entries, against the advantages of the standard subfield system, which is easier to implement. 

A statement that linking fields are present or absent together with a note of the type of contents in such linking fields, should be given in the documentation to accompany exchange records. For details, see Appendix K. 

Within the Linking Entry Fields Section, both methods are described in the order: (A) embedded fields technique then (B) the standard subfields technique. All examples illustrate both methods. 

Each linking entry field in a record will contain subfields that identify the item to which the link is being made. The data in this field should be sufficient to identify the record for the item being linked to, or, if there is no record, to identify the item itself. 

In the following list the fields are labelled by the type of record to which the link is being made, e.g. 410 SERIES is used in a subseries record to link to the series of which it is a part. 

The following fields are defined: 

Series, supplements, etc.

It is recommended that embedded fields are entered in numerical order of tag within each field. In the case of an embedded 001 field, neither indicators nor subfield identifiers are defined so that the subfield data includes only the tag and the number (EX 1). <SEEEX N="1A"/>

If a linking field contains the record control number of the linked record, this record should be included in the same file for distribution purposes. 

Linking fields constructed from a full record should contain the following required data when present: 

001 RECORD IDENTIFIER
500 UNIFORM TITLE
OR (if 500 not present in the record)
200 $a Title Proper 

7-- Primary Intellectual Responsibility (if present)

In some cases these optional fields may be needed to identify the item, e.g. 210 PUBLICATION, DISTRIBUTION, ETC. for 45- OTHER EDITIONS. 

It is not recommended that additional fields be included. 

Linking fields not constructed from a full record should contain as much of this data as possible, given the practices of the source agency. 

At the least they should contain the data listed above, but need not include the record identifier.

This example illustrates a link from a volume to a multivolume monograph that is at the set level. The item being catalogued vol. 2 is one piece of the set. The record for the set should be present in the same file and will have as its 001 record identifier: 
77-10346. The agency creating the record does not make a note relating to the set in the record for the volume being catalogued and has therefore set the second indicator to 0. To produce an access point from this field, it may be necessary to find the record referred to in the 001 field. An access point point generated from the record to which this field points would appear as follows:

Where there is a choice of system, the agency should weigh the advantages of the linking entry system, which allows fuller although more complex entries, against the advantages of the standard subfield system, which is easier to implement. 

A statement that linking fields are present or absent together with a note of the type of contents in such linking fields, should be given in the documentation to accompany exchange records. For details, see Appendix K. 

Within the Linking Entry Fields Section, both methods are described in the order: (A) embedded fields technique then (B) the standard subfields technique. All examples illustrate both methods. 

Each linking entry field in a record will contain subfields that identify the item to which the link is being made. The data in this field should be sufficient to identify the record for the item being linked to, or, if there is no record, to identify the item itself.

		<DESCRIPTION>The primary purpose of UNIMARC is to facilitate the international exchange of bibliographic data in machinereadable form between national bibliographic agencies. UNIMARC may also be used as a model for the development of new machinereadable bibliographic formats" - Purpose and Scope of UNIMARC. 

It is therefore important that the UNIMARC format be hospitable to other MARC formats: otherwise conversion to and from UNIMARC is difficult or even impossible. 

For this reason the technique of embedded fields has been supplemented by a technique using standard subfields. The structure of the agency's records will determine which system of linking entry fields is used. 

Where there is a choice of system, the agency should weigh the advantages of the linking entry system, which allows fuller although more complex entries, against the advantages of the standard subfield system, which is easier to implement. 

A statement that linking fields are present or absent together with a note of the type of contents in such linking fields, should be given in the documentation to accompany exchange records. For details, see Appendix K. 

Within the Linking Entry Fields Section, both methods are described in the order: (A) embedded fields technique then (B) the standard subfields technique. All examples illustrate both methods. 

Each linking entry field in a record will contain subfields that identify the item to which the link is being made. The data in this field should be sufficient to identify the record for the item being linked to, or, if there is no record, to identify the item itself. 
		The above fields are used to link a serial being catalogued to a preceding title. Fields 431-437 are used in preference to 430 when it is required to elaborate on the 'preceding' relationship. Where an agency uses the above fields they should be distinguished as follows: 

Continues: the new title replaces the earlier title without a change in numbering; 

Supersedes: the new title replaces the earlier title and the numbering of the earlier one is not continued; 

Absorbed: a serial was in existence before it absorbed an earlier serial and it continues with its own numbering. 

Separated from: the new title was once a part of a still existing title.

It is therefore important that the UNIMARC format be hospitable to other MARC formats: otherwise conversion to and from UNIMARC is difficult or even impossible. 

For this reason the technique of embedded fields has been supplemented by a technique using standard subfields. The structure of the agency's records will determine which system of linking entry fields is used. 

Where there is a choice of system, the agency should weigh the advantages of the linking entry system, which allows fuller although more complex entries, against the advantages of the standard subfield system, which is easier to implement. 

A statement that linking fields are present or absent together with a note of the type of contents in such linking fields, should be given in the documentation to accompany exchange records. For details, see Appendix K. 

Within the Linking Entry Fields Section, both methods are described in the order: (A) embedded fields technique then (B) the standard subfields technique. All examples illustrate both methods. 

Each linking entry field in a record will contain subfields that identify the item to which the link is being made. The data in this field should be sufficient to identify the record for the item being linked to, or, if there is no record, to identify the item itself. 
		The above fields are used to link a serial being catalogued to a preceding title. Fields 431-437 are used in preference to 430 when it is required to elaborate on the 'preceding' relationship. Where an agency uses the above fields they should be distinguished as follows: 

Continues: the new title replaces the earlier title without a change in numbering; 

Supersedes: the new title replaces the earlier title and the numbering of the earlier one is not continued; 

Absorbed: a serial was in existence before it absorbed an earlier serial and it continues with its own numbering.

		<DESCRIPTION>The primary purpose of UNIMARC is to facilitate the international exchange of bibliographic data in machinereadable form between national bibliographic agencies. UNIMARC may also be used as a model for the development of new machinereadable bibliographic formats" - Purpose and Scope of UNIMARC. 

It is therefore important that the UNIMARC format be hospitable to other MARC formats: otherwise conversion to and from UNIMARC is difficult or even impossible. 

For this reason the technique of embedded fields has been supplemented by a technique using standard subfields. The structure of the agency's records will determine which system of linking entry fields is used. 

Where there is a choice of system, the agency should weigh the advantages of the linking entry system, which allows fuller although more complex entries, against the advantages of the standard subfield system, which is easier to implement. 

A statement that linking fields are present or absent together with a note of the type of contents in such linking fields, should be given in the documentation to accompany exchange records. For details, see Appendix K. 

Within the Linking Entry Fields Section, both methods are described in the order: (A) embedded fields technique then (B) the standard subfields technique. All examples illustrate both methods. 

Each linking entry field in a record will contain subfields that identify the item to which the link is being made. The data in this field should be sufficient to identify the record for the item being linked to, or, if there is no record, to identify the item itself. 
		The above fields are used to link a serial being catalogued to a preceding title. Fields 431-437 are used in preference to 430 when it is required to elaborate on the 'preceding' relationship. Where an agency uses the above fields they should be distinguished as follows: 

Continues: the new title replaces the earlier title without a change in numbering; 

Supersedes: the new title replaces the earlier title and the numbering of the earlier one is not continued; 

Absorbed: a serial was in existence before it absorbed an earlier serial and it continues with its own numbering. 

Separated from: the new title was once a part of a still existing title.

		<DESCRIPTION>The primary purpose of UNIMARC is to facilitate the international exchange of bibliographic data in machinereadable form between national bibliographic agencies. UNIMARC may also be used as a model for the development of new machinereadable bibliographic formats" - Purpose and Scope of UNIMARC. 

It is therefore important that the UNIMARC format be hospitable to other MARC formats: otherwise conversion to and from UNIMARC is difficult or even impossible. 

For this reason the technique of embedded fields has been supplemented by a technique using standard subfields. The structure of the agency's records will determine which system of linking entry fields is used. 

Where there is a choice of system, the agency should weigh the advantages of the linking entry system, which allows fuller although more complex entries, against the advantages of the standard subfield system, which is easier to implement. 

A statement that linking fields are present or absent together with a note of the type of contents in such linking fields, should be given in the documentation to accompany exchange records. For details, see Appendix K. 

Within the Linking Entry Fields Section, both methods are described in the order: (A) embedded fields technique then (B) the standard subfields technique. All examples illustrate both methods. 

Each linking entry field in a record will contain subfields that identify the item to which the link is being made. The data in this field should be sufficient to identify the record for the item being linked to, or, if there is no record, to identify the item itself. 
		This field is used to link the serial being catalogued to two or more other serials which precede it and which were merged to form it.

For this reason the technique of embedded fields has been supplemented by a technique using standard subfields. The structure of the agency's records will determine which system of linking entry fields is used. 

Where there is a choice of system, the agency should weigh the advantages of the linking entry system, which allows fuller although more complex entries, against the advantages of the standard subfield system, which is easier to implement. 

A statement that linking fields are present or absent together with a note of the type of contents in such linking fields, should be given in the documentation to accompany exchange records. For details, see Appendix K. 

Within the Linking Entry Fields Section, both methods are described in the order: (A) embedded fields technique then (B) the standard subfields technique. All examples illustrate both methods. 

Each linking entry field in a record will contain subfields that identify the item to which the link is being made. The data in this field should be sufficient to identify the record for the item being linked to, or, if there is no record, to identify the item itself. 	
	The above fields are used to link a serial being catalogued to its succeeding title. Fields 441-445 are used in preference to 440 when it is desired to elaborate on the 'succeeding' relationship. Where an agency uses the above fields they should be distinguished as follows: 

Continued by: the new title replaces the earlier title without a change in numbering; 

Superseded by: the new title replaces the earlier title and the numbering of the earlier one is not continued; 

Absorbed by: the serial being catalogued ceases to exist but is continued by the serial referred to in field 444 or 445, although this serial continues it previous numbering.

It is therefore important that the UNIMARC format be hospitable to other MARC formats: otherwise conversion to and from UNIMARC is difficult or even impossible. 

For this reason the technique of embedded fields has been supplemented by a technique using standard subfields. The structure of the agency's records will determine which system of linking entry fields is used. 

Where there is a choice of system, the agency should weigh the advantages of the linking entry system, which allows fuller although more complex entries, against the advantages of the standard subfield system, which is easier to implement. 

A statement that linking fields are present or absent together with a note of the type of contents in such linking fields, should be given in the documentation to accompany exchange records. For details, see Appendix K. 

Within the Linking Entry Fields Section, both methods are described in the order: (A) embedded fields technique then (B) the standard subfields technique. All examples illustrate both methods. 

Each linking entry field in a record will contain subfields that identify the item to which the link is being made. The data in this field should be sufficient to identify the record for the item being linked to, or, if there is no record, to identify the item itself.

It is therefore important that the UNIMARC format be hospitable to other MARC formats: otherwise conversion to and from UNIMARC is difficult or even impossible. 

For this reason the technique of embedded fields has been supplemented by a technique using standard subfields. The structure of the agency's records will determine which system of linking entry fields is used. 

Where there is a choice of system, the agency should weigh the advantages of the linking entry system, which allows fuller although more complex entries, against the advantages of the standard subfield system, which is easier to implement. 

A statement that linking fields are present or absent together with a note of the type of contents in such linking fields, should be given in the documentation to accompany exchange records. For details, see Appendix K.

A monograph Buses of the East Midlands is part of a monograph series. Within the record of the monograph there is a field linking to the series entitled Fleetbooks which is represented by its title. This item is number 7 in the series. Note the use of subfield $v in the embedded 200 field: although it is embedded in a reference to the monographic series, it is specific to the monograph.

It is therefore important that the UNIMARC format be hospitable to other MARC formats: otherwise conversion to and from UNIMARC is difficult or even impossible. 

For this reason the technique of embedded fields has been supplemented by a technique using standard subfields. The structure of the agency's records will determine which system of linking entry fields is used. 

Where there is a choice of system, the agency should weigh the advantages of the linking entry system, which allows fuller although more complex entries, against the advantages of the standard subfield system, which is easier to implement. 

A statement that linking fields are present or absent together with a note of the type of contents in such linking fields, should be given in the documentation to accompany exchange records. For details, see Appendix K. 

Within the Linking Entry Fields Section, both methods are described in the order: (A) embedded fields technique then (B) the standard subfields technique. All examples illustrate both methods. 

Each linking entry field in a record will contain subfields that identify the item to which the link is being made. The data in this field should be sufficient to identify the record for the item being linked to, or, if there is no record, to identify the item itself.

A piece-analytic is a bibliographic item that is part of and not physically separate from its host item. 

Since a link to a piece-analytic is inherently a downward link, it should not be used unless the piece is at the highest level. Instead upward links to the piece should be made (using field 463) in the record for the piece-analytic.

		<DESCRIPTION>The primary purpose of UNIMARC is to facilitate the international exchange of bibliographic data in machinereadable form between national bibliographic agencies. UNIMARC may also be used as a model for the development of new machinereadable bibliographic formats" - Purpose and Scope of UNIMARC. 

It is therefore important that the UNIMARC format be hospitable to other MARC formats: otherwise conversion to and from UNIMARC is difficult or even impossible. 

For this reason the technique of embedded fields has been supplemented by a technique using standard subfields. The structure of the agency's records will determine which system of linking entry fields is used. 

Where there is a choice of system, the agency should weigh the advantages of the linking entry system, which allows fuller although more complex entries, against the advantages of the standard subfield system, which is easier to implement. 

A statement that linking fields are present or absent together with a note of the type of contents in such linking fields, should be given in the documentation to accompany exchange records. For details, see Appendix K. 

Within the Linking Entry Fields Section, both methods are described in the order: (A) embedded fields technique then (B) the standard subfields technique. All examples illustrate both methods. 

Each linking entry field in a record will contain subfields that identify the item to which the link is being made. The data in this field should be sufficient to identify the record for the item being linked to, or, if there is no record, to identify the item itself. 
		This field is used to link the item being catalogued to another item when the specific relationship is not provided for in the other 4-- fields or cannot be determined from the source format</DESCRIPTION>

			<DESCRIPTION>The second indicator indicates whether the agency providing the record would use the data in this field to make a note for print or other displays of the record. If a note is not required, this indicator should be set to 0 (EX 1, 4, 6). The kinds of notes envisaged being created using this data are illustrated in the examples (EX 2, 3, 5). When the record is displayed, the specific field tag may be translated into text that describes the exact relationship of the item to which the link is being made and the item being catalogued: the exact wording of the text depends on the practices of the agency receiving the record. </DESCRIPTION>

		</SUBFIELD>
		<NOTES>Access points and notes: 

The titles in the 5-- block are used to generate title and author/title access points in addition to the title in field 200 $a. Note that the title in the first occurrence of 200 $a can be coded as an access point through the indicator position 1 of field 200 and this form of title is thus not repeated in the 5-- block. 

The contents of a related title field may be used for access points and to generate notes. For the latter use, a print constant may be generated based on the field tag. 

Linking entries: 

Titles in the 5-- block are not links to other records but are alternative titles associated with the item being catalogued. However, a 5-- field may be embedded in a 4-- field in addition to or instead of the title proper (200) of the bibliographic entity to which a link is being made. See EX 3 in the introduction to 4-- LINKING ENTRY BLOCK for an embedded key title. 

Punctuation: 

Punctuation is entered in the fields in the 5-- block according to the practice of the cataloguing agency. 

Non-sorting characters: 

Any nonsorting characters at the beginning of the title may be dropped as part of the creation of the exchange tape. Alternatively the Bibliographic Control Set (ISO 6630) characters 08/08 and 08/09 may be used. As pointed out in paragraph 4.6 of the preparatory material, NSB and NSE indicate the use of these characters in the examples. 

Parallel variant title: 

Parallel variant titles are recorded by repeating the appropriate variant title field. Subfield $z may be used in any field 510-541 to indicate the language of the title in that field. 

Other variant titles: 

Field 517 may be used for titles which should be entered in fields 510-516 but which because of the lack of specificity in the source format cannot be allocated to the correct field. 

Items where there is more than one title proper: 

Where there is more than one title proper, i.e. the document consists of several works and has no common title, subsequent dependent titles (e.g. parallel titles proper) should be entered in the 423 fields holding the 200$a to which they relate. For an example see 423 ISSUED WITH (EX 2).

		<NOTES>The uniform title should be entered according to the rules of the inputting agency. The use made of uniform titles varies considerably between one agency and the next even when the same cataloguing rules are used. Those uniform titles which are main entry headings, i.e. those used primarily for anonymous classics, are an essential part of the record and must be exchanged, since they may be the only access point. Other uniform titles which never appear as a main entry heading are less significant, but it is recommended nonetheless that they be included in the exchange record. 

Each cataloguing code has its own preferences for the form of headings, depending usually on tradition and language of cataloguing. Although no international standards exist, the following documents published by the IFLA International Office for UBC is a step in that direction. 

Anonymous classics : a list of uniform headings for European literatures. London : IFLA/UBC, 1978. 
ISBN: 0-903043-15-7 

List of uniform titles for liturgical works of the Latin rites of the Catholic Church. 2nd ed. rev. London : IFLA/UBC, 1981. ISBN: 0-903043-35-1 

Some cataloguing codes prescribe uniform headings for treaties, laws, protocols, etc. These should also be placed in UNIMARC in field 500, and be regarded as uniform titles. Any places or dates of treaties should be entered in $n Miscellaneous Information (EX 6, 9).
